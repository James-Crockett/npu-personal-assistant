# npu-personal-assistant
found out there are not that many good personal assistants that run locally in your machine. i personally know nothing about npu and how does llms work on them. think this project would be a great learning exprience on how those stuff work.


planning out

have to look into how llms run on npu. 
need a voice to text.
planning to first work it out on linux.
